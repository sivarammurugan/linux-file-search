# Requirements for Linux File Search App

## Core Functionality

### 1. **Real-time File Indexing**
- Monitor filesystem changes using inotify
- Build and maintain an in-memory index of all files
- Support incremental updates when files are added/removed/renamed
- Handle multiple filesystem types (ext4, btrfs, xfs, etc.)

### 2. **Fast Search Capabilities**
- Instant search results as user types
- Support wildcards (`*`, `?`) and regex patterns
- Case-sensitive and case-insensitive search modes
- Search by filename, path, or both
- Support for multiple search terms with AND/OR logic

### 3. **Advanced Filtering**
- Filter by file type/extension
- Filter by file size (with size range support)
- Filter by modification/creation/access dates
- Filter by file permissions and ownership
- Exclude/include specific directories or file patterns

## User Interface Requirements

### 4. **GUI Application**
- Clean, minimal interface similar to "Everything"
- Real-time search results display
- Sortable columns (name, size, date, path)
- Context menu for file operations
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Dark/light theme support

### 5. **CLI Interface**
- Command-line version for terminal users
- JSON/CSV output formats for scripting
- Pipe-friendly output formatting

## Performance Requirements

### 6. **Speed & Efficiency**
- Search results displayed within milliseconds
- Low memory footprint (configurable index size)
- Minimal CPU usage during idle time
- Efficient startup time (< 2 seconds)

### 7. **Scalability**
- Handle millions of files efficiently
- Support for network mounted filesystems
- Configurable indexing depth and exclusions

## System Integration

### 8. **Linux-Specific Features**
- Integration with desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, XFCE)
- Support for symbolic links and hard links
- Handle Linux-specific file attributes
- Respect filesystem permissions and access controls

### 9. **Configuration & Customization**
- User-configurable index locations
- Exclude patterns for directories/files
- Search scope limitations
- Hotkey configuration for global search

## Technical Requirements

### 10. **Data Management**
- SQLite or custom binary format for index storage
- Automatic index rebuilding on corruption
- Export/import index functionality
- Configurable update intervals

### 11. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
- Native Linux binary (no dependencies on Windows libraries)
- Support major Linux distributions
- ARM64 and x86_64 architecture support

### 12. **Security & Privacy**
- Respect file system permissions
- No network connectivity required
- Local-only operation by default
- Optional encrypted index storage
